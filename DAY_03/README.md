Day 3: Control Structures

Tasks/Activities:

Activity 1: if-else Statements

Task 1: write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the conscle.
Task 2: Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age>=18) and log the result to the console.

Activity 2. Nested If-Else Statements

Task 3: Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements

Activity 3: Switch Case

Task 4: Write a program that uses a switch case to determine the day of the weak based on a mumber (1-7) and log the day name to the console. 
Task 5: Write a program that uses a switch case to assign a grade (A, B, C. D. F) based on a score and log the grade to the console.

Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Task 6: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.

Activity 5: Combining Conditions

Task 7: Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) and log the result to the console.

Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will :

- Implanent and understand basic if-else control flow Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions
- Utilize switch cases for controt flow based on specific values
- Apply the ternary operation for concise condition checking.
- Comdisne multiple conditions to solve more complexÂ problems
